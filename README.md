# ReinforcementLearning_FinalCourseProject
The project aims to develop a reinforcement learning model for autonomous control in a dynamic highway environment. It involves cars, pedestrians, and traffic lights, with the goal of optimizing interactions for smooth traffic flow, safety, and efficiency, mirroring real-world traffic systems.
